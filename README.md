# CS1027

This repo is for people that wish to see my coding *quality* and *style*. It contains the assignments for Western University's CS1027 course. I have provided a desccription of each assignment as well as the exact files that I coded from scratch.

### Assignment Description

#### Assignment 1:
A text file compression program that uses the 8 bit compression code for each character to decrease the file size by about 30%. The program can also decompress to get he original text file. 

#### Assignment 2:
A drone delivery program with a GUI map. Implemented using stacks. Grade received: **95%**

#### Assignment 3:
Also a drone delivery program with a GUI map. Implemented with queues. Program also finds the shortest path for the drone. 

#### Assignment 4: 
A text compression and decompression progam. Compression is done by implementing Huffman trees, Binary Tree ADTs, and List ADTs. Grade received: **100%**
